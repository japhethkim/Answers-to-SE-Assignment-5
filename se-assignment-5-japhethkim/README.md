# SE-Assignment-5
Installation and Navigation of Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
 Downloading and Installing VS Code:

 How to install it:

Download:
Head over to the official VS Code download page [1].

Grab the right file: Under "Download for Windows," make sure to choose the 64-bit version (unless you're on a 32-bit system). Click the button to download the .exe file.

Run the installer: Double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions. You can usually keep the default settings, but you can also choose where to install VS Code on your computer.

Launch VS Code: Once the installation is complete, you should be able to find VS Code in your Start menu or by searching for it.


Making VS Code My Own

After installing VS Code, I can personalize it to make coding more comfortable. Here are a few things I can adjust:

Themes: VS Code comes with different themes to change the overall look and feel. I can access themes by going to File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS) and searching for "Theme." There are also many cool themes available in the VS Code Marketplace [1]
Fonts: I can adjust the font size and family for better readability. Just go to the same settings menu and search for "Font Size" or "Font Family" to make changes.

Learning the VS Code Interface

VS Code's interface is pretty straightforward. Here are the main parts I should know:

Activity Bar (leftmost bar): This bar provides quick access to different VS Code features like Git, Extensions, and the terminal. I can click on an icon to open the corresponding tool.
Side Bar (second from left): This bar shows my project folders, open files, search results, and the integrated terminal. I can expand/collapse folders and navigate my project files here.
Editor Group (center area): This is where I write my code. I can have multiple files open at the same time in different tabs within the editor group.
Status Bar (bottom bar): This bar shows information about the current file (e.g., language, line endings), indentation settings, and Git status if I'm using it.

Command Palette

The Command Palette is a powerful tool that lets me access almost anything in VS Code through a search bar. To open it, I just need to press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS). Then, I can start typing what I need to do, and VS Code will suggest relevant options.

Here are some examples of what I can do with the Command Palette

Open a new file
Search for specific text within my project
Format code
Install extensions
Start debugging my code (more on that later!)

Supercharging VS Code with Extensions

Extensions are like add-ons for VS Code that give me extra functionality for specific programming languages or tasks. To find and install extensions, I can click on the Extensions icon (puzzle piece icon) in the Activity Bar. The VS Code Marketplace [1] has a ton of extensions available, so I can search for something that helps me with the coding language I'm learning, like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.



VS Code has a built-in terminal that I can use to run command-line tools and interact with my operating system directly within the editor. This is super convenient because I don't need to switch back and forth between different windows.

To open the terminal, I can go to Terminal > New Terminal (menu bar) or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+** (Windows).
